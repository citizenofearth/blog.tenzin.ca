Essentially, it is the multidisciplinary field that uses scientific methods, processes, algorithms, and systems to obtain insights and information from structured and unstructured digital data. This data is usually very difficult to interpret by humans. Machines allow us to interpret, process, and alter this data very effectively.

Data science combines statistics, data analysis, machine learning, and their related methods in order to understand and analyze actual phenomena.

The digitization of data was not the only factor in data science's emergence. Data sets had to become very large, while accessing and manipulating these data sets had to become very fast.

## Data Analysis

Due to the enormous scale of modern big data, finding meaning requires tools such as SQL, Python, or R. SQL, standing for "structured query language" is the language for accessing and manipulating databases. Python is a general purpose language that emphasizes code readability. R is a language and environment for statistical computing and graphics. These allow data analysts to aggregate and manipulate data to the point where they can present meaningful conclusions.

## Experimentation

Knowing how to run an effective experiment, keeping the data clean, and analyzing it appropriately is what makes up the life of a data scientist. Ineffective experimentation leads to biases, which leads to false conclusions.

## Machine Learning

Data scientists define machine learning (ML) as the scientific study of algorithms and statistical models that machines use to effectively perform a specific task without using explicit instructions, but instead relying on patterns and inference. It is seen as a subset of artificial intelligence. Machine learning algorithms build a mathematical model of sample data, known as "training data", in order to make predictions or decisions without being explicitly programmed to perform that task.

Machine learning tasks can be classified into several broad categories: supervised learning, unsupervised learning, and reinforcement learning.

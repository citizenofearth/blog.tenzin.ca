[React](https://reactjs.org/) is, quite simply, the view in MVC.  It is a front-end library developed by Facebook and used to handle the view layer of a mobile or web app.  React allows us to create reusable UI components and is currently one of the most popular JavaScript libraries with a strong foundation and large community backing it up.

React heavily encourages the creation of reusable UI components, which present data that changes over time.  React abstracts away the DOM from you, offering a simpler programming model and better performance.  React can also render on the server using Node, and it can even power native apps using React Native.  React implements one-way reactive data flow, which reduces boilerplate and is easier to wrap your head around compared to traditional data binding.

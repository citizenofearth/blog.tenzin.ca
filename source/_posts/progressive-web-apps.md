### progressive web apps

are user experiences that have the reach of the web and are:

- Reliable : load instantly and never show downtime, even in uncertain network conditions.
- Fast : respond quickly to user interactions with smooth transitions and scrolling.
- Engaging : feels like a native app on the device with an immersive user experience.

This new level of quality allows progressive web apps, or PWAs, to earn a place on the user's home screen.
